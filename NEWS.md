# rutils 0.99.0

NEW FEATURES

* Added a `NEWS.md` file to track changes to the package.
* Deprecated `run_ewce()`, on account of major changes to the structure of EWCE, which made this function redundant. See [MultiEWCE](https://github.com/neurogenomics/MultiEWCE/) and EWCE [news](https://github.com/NathanSkene/EWCE/blob/master/NEWS.md).
