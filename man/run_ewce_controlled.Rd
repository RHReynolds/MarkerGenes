\title{Run EWCE with control for GC content and transcript length.}
\usage{
run_ewce_controlled(list_of_genes, ..., reps,
  genelistSpecies = c("human"), sctSpecies = c("mouse", "human"))
}
\arguments{
\item{list_of_genes}{List with gene lists.}

\item{...}{Names of input ctds. An individual ctd, should have been generated
using \code{generate.celltype.data} from the EWCE package, and contains
mean expression and specificity matrices from a scRNAseq study.}

\item{reps}{Number of repeats that should be performed in bootstrapping.}

\item{genelistSpecies}{Has to be human, as geneSizeControl is set to TRUE,
and this requires extracting GC content and transcript length from the
human ENSEMBL.}

\item{sctSpecies}{Either 'mouse' or 'human' depending on the ctd datasets
being used. Species must be the same across all input ctds.}
}
\value{
A dataframe of EWCE results for each of the gene lists in each study.
}
\description{
Perform EWCE bootstrapping across several gene lists in more than one
specificity matrix.
